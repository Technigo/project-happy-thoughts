My reflections on how this week's project turned out:

Still catching up on React after taking a 2-week hiatus from Technigo, so I found this project very challenging. I'm happy with the end result, but I've relied a lot on peeking at other people's code. My focus was on ensuring that I properly understood how the app works, and I did so by adding thorough explanations for every block of code via comments.

Things I'd like to have clarified or explained in more detail:

I'm still struggling with APIs and React props in particular; I'll be spending more time on those two topics in the days to come.
