My reflections on how this week's project turned out:
I'm very happy with this week's project. I really enjoyed working with POST-requests, and as I had to move stuff around a lot I feel I really got the chance to grasp how to work with component structures. I'm a bit dissapointed in myself when it comes to committing my work, I tend to forget it, and the result of that you can see in this project. Sorry about that, I'll get better.

Things I'd like to have clarified or explained in more detail:
It would be nice to learn a bit more about useEffect (and maybe useState a little too). Passing data upwards through callback functions would be nice to hear a bit more on too.
