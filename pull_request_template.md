My reflections on how this week's project turned out:

Overall i'm very happy with the way this project turned out. I like the way it was explained on the week's lessons: step by step and with a graphic to get a hint of what goes on in every step. We debated in my team whether it was good or not to work with this almost like in a codealong. Personally I think it's very much needed because I had never seen how this works before and I really need this first approach to start doing it by myself later on in my career.

Things I'd like to have clarified or explained in more detail:

I would like to have more clarification and practice on JavaScript methods applied to functions because I can't always really make them work.
