My reflections on how this week's project turned out:

This weeks project was a challenge for me, especially to grasp a components life cycle and how to useEffect to perform actions based on a components life cycle. It was interesting when I went into an infinite loop with useEffect but I learned a lot from that small mistake.

Things I'd like to have clarified or explained in more detail:

There are many things I would love explained, so more specifically I am interested in learning how to handling HTTP requests and response properly. Also of course a better understanding of a components life cycle, which this week was fully focused on!
