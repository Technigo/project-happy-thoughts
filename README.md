# Happy Thoughts

The aim of the project was to practice React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API. The API was built using node.js and can be found in the project happy-thoughts-api (https://github.com/elsareutersward/project-happy-thoughts-api).

## The problem

To solve the problem I worked with using API's in React and setting up a fetch request. I used a form to post new happy thoughts to the API and implemented a button to send likes on thoughts. To achieve this I used 'useState', 'useEffect' and 'localStorage'. To make the site more responsive for the user I made a loading spinner to handle loading states, set up an error message when validation fails, set up a counter to show character limit for the text input and display the number of times a user has liked a post.
