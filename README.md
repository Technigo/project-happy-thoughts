# Happy Thoughts

This is a project built during Technigo Bootcamp. The site is a twitter-like page where the user can post happy thoughts.

The focuse of the project was to practice how to use the useEffect hook in React to perform actions when components mount, unmount, or when state changes and how to call APIs from React and put the data into state.

## The problem

I started building the logic in App.js where i put states, useEffect and fetch requests. Later I decided to divide the site into components, one for input and one for the message list.
