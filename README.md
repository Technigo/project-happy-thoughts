Project Happy Thoughts - https://project-happy-thoughts-hannah-ek.netlify.app

🏁 Goals:

I was tasked with building a Twitter like app using an API to collect 'Happy Thoughts' in React and I have successfully completed what I set out to do.

The app has three main functionalities - adding thoughts, listing thoughts, and toggling a 'like' status. I decided to keep the design quite simple as I did not wan't it to be overly complex.

Overall, I found this project to be a great opportunity to flex my React muscles and bring together different parts of React and working with fetching and posting to an API. I am very pleased with the outcome and I'm looking forward to using the skills and knowledge I gained from this project in future endeavors.

Must-have requirements:

✅ Follow a given design as close as possible.

✅ List the most recent thoughts at the top and older thoughts at the bottom (sorted).

✅ Show the content of the message and how many likes the thoughts have received.

✅ Have a form to post new thoughts.

✅ Implement a heart button to send likes on a thought.

🚧 The problem:

I started by going through the design and sketching the different components out, deciding on how to structure my app. Then I started building also decided on adding a loading component for when the page re-renders. 

If I had more time, I would add more functionality.
