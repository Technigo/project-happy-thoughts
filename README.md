# Happy Thoughts

Small Twitter-like application collecting happy thoughts. The application is fetching and posting data by using React and three API endpoints.

## The problem

The application is split up into components for posting new thoughts to the api, listing thoughts fetched from the API, liking thoughts and posting the likes to the API.

If I had more time I would like to show the remaining character limit of the textarea and create a loading messae when waiting for the response from the API.
