# Happy Thoughts

This assignment involves fetching and posting data into an API from React, putting data into a state and using the 'useEffect'Â hook in React to perform actions when components mount, unmount, or when state changes.

## The problem

I started with making a ThoughtsList component that maps through all the thoughts currently in the API and displays them, followed by a ThoughtForm component that displays a form for the user to enter their own happy tought, which is them added to the list.
