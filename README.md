# Happy Thoughts

The assignment was to build a Twitter-like web app using React. It should have a form to post happy thoughts + list the most recent thoughts.

## Approach

I split it up in components, using props and state to keep track of the thoughts and number of likes. I also added a counter to visualize number of characters in the textarea. The submit button gets disabled if the user types less than 5 or more than 140 characters.
