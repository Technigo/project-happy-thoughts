# Happy Thoughts
This project was made during week 11 of the Technigo Bootcamp. The assignment was to build a twitter-like site where a user can post messages to an API, and those messages render in the browser. 

## The problem
The project is written with React, so I started with planning and structuring the components. I started with building the post function, and later on the "like"-function on the messages.

I'm really proud that I managed to add conditional classes, this was my first attempt at this.

If I had more time I would have explored animations a bit more, I would have wanted to add a animation to the buttons. I would also add error messages that is connected to the JSON.
