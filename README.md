# Happy Thoughts

Replace this readme with your own information about your project.

In this project I am doing a fetch of an API and prints out 20 of the latest happy thought posts. Every post is shown in a card component and with the form component it is possible to post a thought of your own. 

## The problem

I had troubles with getting the like button to work. It seemed like I had to make both a key prop and an id prop to be able to target a post by its id. I made different components for the list of messages, the form for posting thoughts and a reusable component for the message card. I have used methods in like useState, useEffect, fetch etc.
