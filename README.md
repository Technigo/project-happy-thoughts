# Happy Thoughts

The goal of this project was to get to know useEffect and how to make use of it with API calls.

## The problem

I approached this project by sketching out what components I was going to need and what their dependencies would be. I focused on fulfilling the blue goals first and made sure that everything was working as expected (from the user's perspective), like for example that the like button could only be clicked once.
After that, I added the functionalities for the red and some black goals one at a time.

This project was updated to work with an API created by me and Erika Andersson Porath in a pair-programming project. During that project, I've also added infinite scrolling and the username feature.
