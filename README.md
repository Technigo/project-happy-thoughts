# Happy Thoughts
This weeks project in the Technigo Bootcamp was to use React to build a Twitter-like app to fetch and post data to an API.

## The problem

## Learning objectives
* How to use APIs in React, firing requests within useEffect
* Learn more about working with useState
* How to put the result of API responses into React state to show in the page
* What it's like to work with an API which you both send and receive data from
* Implement a given design
