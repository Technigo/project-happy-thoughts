# Happy Thoughts

In this week's project, we practiced React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API.
The site had a design we were to follow closely. 
It should list the most recent thoughts at the top and older thoughts at the bottom (sorted).
The posts should show the content of the message and how many likes they've received.
There was to be a form to post new thoughts.
The heart button was to send likes on a thought.

## The problem

I used React for this project. The example project for this week was a big help for this. I also googled and used StackOverflow to answer questions.
