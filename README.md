# Happy Thoughts
This project was made druing week 11 of the Technigo Bootcamp. The assignment was to build a twitter-like site where a user can post messages to an API, and those messages render in the browser. 

## The problem
The project is written with React, so I started with planning and structuring the components. I started with building the post function, and later on the "like"-function on the messages.

I'm really proud that I managed to add a conditional class.

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?
