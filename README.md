# Happy Thoughts ðŸ’Œ

Send Happy Thoughts is a project I made when doing the Technigo bootcamp (autumn 2020). The project was to practice my React state skills by fetching data from an API called Happy Thoughts.

Send Happy Thoughts is a web app where you can post, view and like happy thoughts.

## The problem ðŸ’¡

- This project is built with JavaScript, using the React framework. It consists of 3 components and an App.js file, with a style sheet for each component.  
- The view, like and post features is implemented by the API fetches, using GET method to receive data, and POST method to like and post. 
- The app also have additional features build with JavaScript function, such as word count validation. 
- The layout is structured with CSS Flexbox. 
- The app was built with the mobile first approach and works responsive in tablet and computer.
