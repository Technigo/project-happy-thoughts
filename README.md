# Happy Thoughts

This week we were creating a twitter, but with love. Fetching post and get requests from an API.

UPDATE: my own created backend added to the project.

## The problem
 
 We got a pretty strict design to follow but it was not all that hard. I got the API working pretty smoothly and not many problems in the way.

 UPDATE: after fetching my own API I had to make some changes in the code. I used some different namings, but when I figuredd that out it worked fine. Did not change anything in the deign fot this week as I like the "cleaness" of it.
