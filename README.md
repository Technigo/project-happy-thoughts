## The problem

This week was really challening, But the exampel is easy to follow, and the lectures with Daniel clears things up. I planned when i wanted things to be done:
learning monday, the "base" on tuseday, and hopefully finishing on thursday (im writing this on saturday :) ) I used stackOverflow, my teammates.
and ofcourse my best friend google, do get things to work.
I try to fix things myself, but its easier if i ask for help earlier then later.

If i had more time i would style it more cool, and do more "extra" stuff.
