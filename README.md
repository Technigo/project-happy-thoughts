# Happy Thoughts

The task was to build a simple Twitter-like app in order to practice fetching and posting data using React. 
It uses an API deployed on Google Cloud - [source repo here](https://github.com/a-well/project-happy-thoughts-api).

## The problem


I began with fetching the data, then added the posting and liking functionality. If I had more time I'd add a limit to the characters one can send in a tought (140), and perhaps make the form submit upon pressing enter.


### Technologies used:

- HTML
- CSS
- React
- fetch

- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code formatting
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for deployment
