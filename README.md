# Happy Thoughts

This project's goals is to learn about a React component's lifecycle and how to react to that. We looked at how to react to changes in state or a component mounting using useEffect. We worked with a Happy Thoughts API which showcases previously posted thoughts, gives us the possibility to post new thoughts and also give likes to the already existing ones 💌

Update:
I have now created my own Happy Thoughts API to use for this project: it's an Express API using MongoDB Atlas and deployed to Heroku ✌

You can find it live here: https://happy-thoughts-backend.herokuapp.com/

And it repository including Documentation here: https://github.com/DALA746/project-happy-thoughts-api

# What I learned 

- What component lifecycle means.
- How to use the `useEffect` hook in React to perform actions when components mount, unmount, or when state changes.
- How to call APIs from React and put the data into state.
- What it's like to work with an API which you both send and receive data from.
