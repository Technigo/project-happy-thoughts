# Happy Thoughts

A twitter like application built in React, where we get messages, post messages and handle likes by using a happy thought API.

## The problem

I started with sketching the components and their content on paper, and built my application around that. I got a better overview keeping both API calls and JSX belonging to one component in that component, instead of having all API calls further up in the component structure. Am using State and Effect hooks, and played around with those to get a better understanding. Next I would like to have all the API calls in a separate fetch component, as this would make the component code cleaner.
