# Happy Thoughts

This week we built a Twitter-like app were the user can post Happy thoughts.

We learned how to use APIs in React and to use useEffect. And to post the result of API results into React State.

## The problem

I started out with fetching the APIs putting them into a seperate components folder.
Then I used two other components, one for form and one for the messages/thoughts.
I also added a counter that controls how many words the user can and have to type, controlled thrue the button.

I hade some problems with the input area and also with the fetch at first but that got solved thrue the eyes of my classmates, it was mostly small typos like normal ticks instead of backticks.
The date was also a bit tricky but I got help from classmates solving that.
