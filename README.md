# Happy Thoughts

This project was to practice my React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API. The user can read and post messages and like others posts.
## The problem

I divided the code into components with different responsibilities and fetched the posts that were already in the API, built a form for new posts and a send button etc. 
If I had more time I would add a counter for the characters.
