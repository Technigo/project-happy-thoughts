# Happy Thoughts

This is the Happy Thought Project. It's a website built in React that uses an API to show a feed of thoughts. You can also post a thought and like the thougths that are posted.

## The problem

This project fulfills these requirements:
**ðŸ”µ  Blue Level **

- Your page should follow the design as closely as possible
- You should list the most recent thoughts at the top and older thoughts at the bottom (sorted)
- Your thoughts should show the content of the message and how many likes they've received
- You should have a form to post new thoughts
- You should implement the heart button to send likes on a thought

I had some difficulty making my like-button work at first, but after consulting my teammates about it we managed to solve it.
