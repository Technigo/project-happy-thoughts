## The problem

What component lifecycle means.
How to use the useEffect hook in React to perform actions when components mount, unmount, or when state changes.
How to call APIs from React and put the data into state.

This week you'll be practicing your React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API. 

We've built a simple API to collect 'happy thoughts'. 

To achieve this, we've built an API with three endpoints. N

Fetch messages This will return the latest 20 thoughts from the API,

Send a messageSend a POST request with a JSON body

- Your page should follow the design as closely as possible

- You should have a form to post new thoughts
- You should implement the heart button to send likes on a thought
