# Happy Thoughts

Twitter-like form reading and pushing to a public API, with an input box for the user to share some happy thoughts and see what others have shared.

## The problem

This one was a bit tricky to understand completely. The most difficult part was to submit a thought properly and at the same time fetch the updated response in a manner that made sense to the user. Same thing with the like increase.

Looking back at it, the code is relatively simple and clean. But starting from scratch it was anything but. Great learning experience.
