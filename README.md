This is a project made during the Technigo Bootcamp.

# Happy Thoughts
The assignment was to, using React, create an app where you can post your happy thoughts (similar to Twitter, but happier!). The message is posted to a public API, and the app also fetches the latest 20 messages posted to the API. You can "like" other messages by clicking the heart-button.

I made one component for the form where the user can type their message, and one component for the messages that are fetched from the API. In App, when you post a message, the page is re-rendered.  

To change the color on the heart-button when the message has one or more likes I used ternary operator and CSS. I used the same technique to make a character counter that shows how many characters you've written, and the text turns red when there are 5 or less characters left. 

I followed the design provided by Technigo and tried to resemble it the best I could.

# Update
The project is now updated with my own API from project "Happy thoughts API"
