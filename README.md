# Happy Thoughts
In this week's project, I was be able to practice my React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API.
I've built a simple API to collect 'happy thoughts'. Think of it as my own version of Twitter, but with less negativity, and 100% fewer US presidents using it.

## The problem
Using different methods like: POST, GET.
