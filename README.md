# Happy Thoughts [View Live!](https://awesome-mcclintock-31dad3.netlify.app/)

This week's project have been looking at how to react to changes in state or a component mounting using useEffect.

What I have learnt:

* How to use APIs in React, firing requests within `useEffect`.
* How to put the result of API responses into React state to show in the page.
* What it's like to work with an API which you both send and receive data from.

## The process and structure
I have reached the **RED LEVEL** ❤️

I started off by sketching which component's I wanted and needed useState's and useEffect's.

My first task was to render all Happy Thoughts, so I created my HappyThought.js.

Second thing was to have a component to post your Happy Thought (HappyForm.js).

I was was using both component's in App.js.

At this point I started to understand that I wanted to be able to do something in my HappyForm.js that should trigger my HappyThought.js to be used.

In addition to looking at course material I took support from classmates to understand that I needed to have functions in App.js that I could pass through to my other component's with help of props. So I could callBack to the main component, in this case App.js.    

### Core Tech

* React
* useEffect Hook
* useState Hook
* Fetch (GET & POST)
* Postman
* CSS3

If I had more time I would have looked into local storage and improved styling.
