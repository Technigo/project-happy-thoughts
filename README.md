# Happy Thoughts

This week's project is about creating a Twitter-like website where we can post Happy thoughts and share it with each other. The purpose is to practice React hooks (State, Effect), fetching and posting data to an API.

## The problem

The main approach for this week's challenge was to study the provided design and apply my own features that I want. The general concept of the code structure was provided by the code coaches. I've tried to remake the code and make it my own.
When the functionality parts worked I put more time to do animations and different kind of effects just for practice. I spend more time to add features more than practising React hooks.
If I had more time I'd like to start over and redo this assignment and see if I would've approach the project differently. And to understand React hooks more.
Would also like to add a feature where you can delete posts.
