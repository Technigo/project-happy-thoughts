# Happy Thoughts

In this weeks project I created "Happy Thoughts" - a twitter like site focusing on positivity and friendliness where the user can post own thoughts, and read and like thoughts from others.

### Learning Objectives:

* How to use APIs in React, firing requests within useEffect.
* How to put the result of API responses into React state to show in the page.
* What it's like to work with an API which you both send and receive data from.

## Tech

* React
* React Hooks
* JSX
