# Happy Thoughts

This assignment was created to focus on Useeffect. While fetching happy thoughts and using the Post method to add new thoughts to the Technigo API.

## The problem

First off we had to create a base structure by deciding on how many components are needed to create this React app.
Secondly thanks to the live sessions we were able to get some base code to help out with the Post method.

I used VS code to create the app. The languages used are HTML5, CSS, JS6 and React.
If I had more time I would create a different design.
