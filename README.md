# Happy Thoughts

The project this week was to build a kind of "Twitter" where you can post messages. It was done using states, useEffect and posting and fetching data from an API.

## The problem

It went relatively smooth this week. Managed to reach the blue level fast. The knowledge I got from the week before regarding states and forms was very useful. 
But when I got to adding the error message and animation it got a bit harder. I installed useForm and error hook dependencies but in the end never used them :) I finally figured out the path to the error message and could use that. So basically spent some time in the network tab and tried my way out. The animations took a little time just to get them to look nice together (three different ones). Adding them in the fetch wasn't too hard now that I'm understanding more about states.

If I had more time I would have tried out the localStorage to save all my likes.
