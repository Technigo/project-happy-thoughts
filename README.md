# Happy Thoughts

The assignment this week was to build a twitter inspired page. Where the instructions where to build a form where anyone can post happy thoughts and show the 20 latest messages and have the possibility to like the messages with help of a like-button in the shape of a heart.

## The problem

I started to read up on this weeks material, participated in the live sessions and planned for the project and follow the plan. I made a sketch for visualization and so I would better understand the assignment.

I used google, youtube and asked for help from my team and participated in code session with som of my team mates this week. We help each other out with different problems and shared knowledge on slack.

If I had more time I would have spend more time really understanding the code more and react!
