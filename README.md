# Happy Thoughts

During this project we were learning how to use the `useEffect` hook in React to perform actions when components mount, unmount, or when state changes, how to call APIs from React and put the data into state and work with an API which you both send and receive data from.

Requirements for the project:

* Your page should follow the design as closely as possible

* You should list the most recent thoughts at the top and older thoughts at the bottom (sorted)

* Your thoughts should show the content of the message and how many likes they've received

* You should have a form to post new thoughts

* You should implement the heart button to send likes on a thought

## The problem

As usual, I planned the week in figma, gathered the requirements and tried to break down the problem. I followed the instructions from the course and it went pretty well.
