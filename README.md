# Happy Thoughts

In this project I created a feed of Happy Thoughts fetching and posting data from an API. The project was created using React.


## The problem

I started by creating Main component to act as the parent component and then fetching all necessary data from the API inside it. I then created new fetches using POST method for adding new thoughts and likes to the API and divided the code into smaller components. In the end I added styling and animation features.
