# Happy Thoughts

This is a project within the Technigo frontend boot camp. 

The objective was to practice React state by fetching and posting data to an API; sending, reading and liking messages.

## The problem

I started out by sketching up the components needed and what their role should be. I decided not to split the project up in many components, in order to understand the flow of each function. I used React State and useEffect hooks, and window.location.reload to retreive a fresh set of all new messages. A ternary operator was used to control the length of the text in the form textarea.

If I had more time I would work more on the styling, and also implement an error message when form validation requirements are not met.
