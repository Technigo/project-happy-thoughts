# Happy Thoughts
This week's assignment was about practising our React skills by fetching and posting data to an API, building a Twitter-like app. We had a design spec to follow and the app should list the most recent posts/thoughts at the top of and older thoughts at the bottom. It should contain a form to post new thoughts, a heart button to send likes and number of likes should be displayed.  

## The problem
I started by coding an example project in order to get a better grasp of how to structure the app. We were a couple of students in our group who hung out in our jitsi room while working on our respective projects, helping each other out if anyone got stuck. If I had more time I would prevent the entire page to reload after pressing a like-button.
