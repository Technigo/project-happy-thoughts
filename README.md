# Happy Thoughts

This project is "Happy Thoughts" version of Twitter. 


## Learning goals

How to:
* use APIs in React
* use useEffect hook
* put the result of API responses into React state to show in the page
* work with an API which you send and receive data from. 

I started this project by sketching the project on paper and planning how to divide the components. First I had App, Form and ThoughtList components. Later I created also the Thought component. Then I did the fetch requests and all needed functionalities. I did the styling with CSS and flexbox alongside building the project.

If I would have hade more time I would have made the counter which calculates characters which user types to textarea. Also I would have made some hover effects etc.
