# Happy Thoughts

This is a website built with React that fetches and displays thoughts from API where you can like them!

## The problem

I started writing the fetch for the messages and displaying them and then added the textarea so that you can write your own. Using useEffect the page updates with thoughts and likes. I copied the design that Technigo prepaired exactly. If I have more time I would add a nice paragraph under the textarea thta displays the error messages.
