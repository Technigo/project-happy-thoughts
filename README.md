This is a project for week 11 during the Technigo Bootcamp. The learning objective was to practice useEffect hook and call APIs from React.

# Happy Thoughts

To perform the practices we were assigned to build a page collecting happy thoughts posted as inputs, displaying them in chronological order plus adding a like button giving the possibility to users to post like for every thougt post. An API to fetch the data to our page was already created and ready to be called. The assignment also included a set design for us to imitate.

## The problem

My focus was to practice fetching data from the API and try out the useEffect hook rather than dividing the code into separate components. I started with the fetch of the data needed to show the messages. After that I continued with a new fetch to get the like function to work. Then I began to style the content in order to look as similar as possible to the given design. I also needed to add the functionality to get the heart button to change color depending on number of likes as well as a word counter to show the limit of 140 characters. I used maxLength and the ternary operator for this. If I had more time I would create some components and implement a loader.
