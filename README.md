# Happy Thoughts

This project is about a components lifescycle and useEffect Hook. How to call APIs from React and put the data into state and how to work with the API during sending and receiving data. The design was specifik more or less from Technigo, for this I took outside help so I could focus fully on React. 

This project is connected to project-happy-thoughts-api.

## The problem
My first problem was how to break down the project. Creating the components names was also interesting because it did have an affect on how I could actually read my own code. I did the Example Project a few times to try and figure out the steps, after going through all the material providen from Technigo. I then went on Youtube to understand useEffect and Postman usage because that was also not fully clear to my knowledge. I sketched a lot and wrote down notes for this project. I also got support from my mentor regarding the planning and steps for this project which finally got me to finalize the blue-stage.
