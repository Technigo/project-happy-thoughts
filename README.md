# Happy Thoughts

The aim of the project was to practice React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API. I've used a simple API that collects 'happy thoughts'. 

## The problem

To solve the problem I worked with using API's in React and setting up a fetch request. I used a form to post new happy thoughts to the API and implemented a button to send likes on thoughts. To achieve this I used 'useState', 'useEffect' and 'localStorage'. To make the site more responsive for the user I made a loading spinner to handle loading states, set up an error message when validation fails, set up a counter to show character limit for the text input and display the number of times a user has liked a post.
