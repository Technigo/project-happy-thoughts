# Happy Thoughts

We followed the design provided by Technigo to generate a happy thoughts page. 

## The problem
Using React and Postman to retrieve an API which allows all the students to post happy thoughts within our projects. The project features an input area to add your own happy thought as well as the last 20 happy thoughts uploaded to the system. The previous thoughts display hearts which can be pressed and each selection is counted and the number of hearts/happy thought are listed next to the hearts.
