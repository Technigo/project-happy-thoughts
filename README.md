🤍 Happy Thoughts 🤍

This week's project was Happy Thoughts! An internal chat app built mostly in React, using API calls ✨

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
