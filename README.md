# Happy Thoughts
The goal of this weeks project was to build a "Twitter"kind app. It was implemented using React (states, useEffect, posting and fetching data from an API.) 

## The problem
I had problem updating the number of likes, but managed to to that via fetch request.
## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
