# Happy Thoughts

A twitter like application built in React, where we get messages, post messages and handle likes by using a happy thought API.

## The problem

I started with sketching the components and their content on paper, and built my application around that. I got a better overview keeping both API calls and JSX belonging to one component in that component, instead of having all API calls further up in the component structure. Am using State and Effect hooks, and played around with those to get a better understanding. 

Next: implement delete, update and replace thought, as well as custom error messages (implemented in backend).
