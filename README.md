# Happy Thoughts App - a twitter like tool where you can post inspiring and happy messages to your friends.

In this project, I was able to practice your React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API. (to achieve this I've used a prebuilt API with three end points)

## What I learned 🧠

* How to use APIs in React, firing requests within `useEffect`.
* How to put the result of API responses into React state to show in the page.
* What it's like to work with an API which you both send and receive data from.

## How I got started 💪🏼

I forked a repo, cloned it into my projects folder on my computer and opened up VS Code.
In the terminal, I ran `cd code` to change into the code folder
I installed the dependencies needed for react by running `npm install`
I ran the react development server by running `npm start`
I decided to not follow the design guidelies and added some happy colors. We have enough of a grey scale in Sweden right now ;-)  

## Requirements 🧪

* Your page should follow the design as closely as possible
* You should list the most recent thoughts
* You should have a form to post new thoughts
* You should implement the heart button to send likes on a thought

## If IO had more time 🏃‍♂
If would have wanted to create another one... I have some great ideas :-)
