# Happy Thoughts

This project was made on my 11th week of the bootcamp. The porject was about making a messagefeed, like twitter in React using different component and two API's. 

## The problem

I had no difficulties in fetching the API's and finding the required data, my strugles on the project was with props and my biggest lesson learn for the future is to have "obvious" classnames and and not so similar const names, it can get really confusing. I was 90% done with my project until I messed it up and had to redo everything, but the second time aroung I just followed the teachers git.
