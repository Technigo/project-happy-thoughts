# Happy Thoughts

Simple twitter-like app where you can post happy thoughts. Made to practice React hooks, working with both POST and GET requests to an API, following an already set design etc.

A great exercise in passing different datatypes as props from one component to another, learning more about the flow of it all ðŸ˜ƒ. I started out with three components and by the time I was finished I had five.
