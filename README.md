# Happy Thoughts

Week 7 project with React - the task was to fetch happy thoughts from an API and showing them in a list plus have a form for new happy thoughts where people could post their happy thoughts in and make the new thoughts to also show up in the list.

W 15 - updated this project with my own API for Happy Thoughts.

## The problem

This week started off very good but ended in a catastrophical way for me...
With some help from a former student I managed to solve the problem and finally got my code to work - YEY! Big shoutout to Agnes Ahlman for helping me out.

I had the basic functions working but then when I wanted to add more functionality it just didn't work out and the page was completely blank/white with nothing showing up.
I've been crying, laughing and overall struggling this week but now with a working project I'm so happy and grateful.
