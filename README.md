# Happy Thoughts

In this week's project, the main focus was to practice React useEffect hook, by fetching and posting data to an API. The task was to create a Twitter-like page were the user can post messages as well as see and like other users messages.

## The problem

I divided the work in several stages, trying to grasp and complete each stage before I moved on to the next. 

The first was to set up a "skeleton" for the site, planning what components to use for what purpose, what states and hooks to use, and what jsx-elements they should render.

The second was to make the first fetch work (GET method) and display messages on my page. 

The third was to be able to post your own messages to the API and have it show up on the site.

The fourth was to like messages, sending increased likes to the API and having it show up on the site.

The fifth was adding some extra features, like having the time since posted show up, having error messages show up when the user has written too short or long messages, adding a count for number of characters, etc.

And then finally, styling! Playing around with colors, animations and other stuff.
