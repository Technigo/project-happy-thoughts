# Happy Thoughts

This is a project made in week 11 of the Technigo Bootcamp.The app loosly mimmic a socialnetwork site. The aim was to be able to fetch an api and also post to that same api. Techniques used where useEffect and useState.



## The problem

I've put a lot of hours into this project. Trying to understand all the parts of it. The thing I find most difficult at the moment is the notion of props.
