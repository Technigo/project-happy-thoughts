# Happy Thoughts

Project where you can POST comment, POST like on specific comment, GET the 20 latest comments

## The problem

There was a lack of time this week so I tried to manage the blue requirements
I did not have a problem to set up the initial GET and POST comment. 
It took me a while to figure out the component to POST a like on a specific comment. My first iteration sent like on all 20 latest comments :)

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
