# Happy Thoughts

Assignment 11 at Technigo bootcamp. Project to practice API:s with React, first time using useEffect hooks. 

## The problem

I started by getting console logging a lot to make sure the information was loading properly. After getting all the messages to load I styled the page somewhat and 
added buttons that would get some functionality after that. I got a deeper understanding of the relationships between different components and how to use the state of
the components to trigger different events (like backgroundcolor). If I had more time I would try to break the App component apart more and create more seeparate components.
