# Happy Thoughts

This week our assignment was to practice React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API.

The following criteria should be met:
✓ Your page should follow the design as closely as possible
✓ You should list the most recent thoughts at the top and older thoughts at the bottom (sorted)
✓ Your thoughts should show the content of the message and how many likes they've received
✓ You should have a form to post new thoughts
✓ You should implement the heart button to send likes on a thought

## The problem
What I learned from this week's project is that you cannot plan enough. I overcomplicated things and had to spend quite some time just going back and forth and then cleaning up the code.
