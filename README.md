# Happy Thoughts

The task was to build a  happy "twitter" with useState and useEffect in React and with a specific styling.
I'm also using my own database built with express and Mongo DB.

## The problem

I started with making components for the inputsection and to show the messages, using useState and useEffect. It was tricky to get the data and use props but I'm happy with the result!
