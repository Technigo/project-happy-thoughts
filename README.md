# Happy Thoughts

The happy thoughts project was to build a twitter-like feed where users would posts thoughts which would thhen be displayed using fetch API, useEffect & useState in ReactJS. 

## The problem

The first step was to plan out what components were needed and what states they would use. The materials provided including the live coding sessions, examples and peer support proved to be of much help. When encountered with problems or bugs, I turned to team mates and StackOverflow.
