# Happy Thoughts

On this Twitter like webpage you can post some Happy thoughts and see what other people are posting thank to the Happy Thoughts API. 
A user can see when the previous posts were made and like them as well.
The main goal of this project is to become comfortable with useEffect and getting and posting data from/to APIs with React.

## The problem

This project is build using:
*React+JSX
*CSS
*Moment
*API

The message that a user can post has set limits from 6 to 140 characters according to the rules of the API. I implemented some validation in the input form through the "Send" button that is disabled when the characters number is outside the limits. For visualizing the process for the user there is also a characters counter. 
The likes icon change colors depending on how many likes there are.
I am planning to add a functionality so that a user can add a like only once and receive a friendly error when the message has less than 6 or more than 140 characters.
