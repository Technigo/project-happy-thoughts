# Happy Thoughts

The site built in React where a user can both post thought and see others' thoughts and also give hearts to posts. It uses a public API which is created by Technigo.

• How to use the useEffect hook in React to perform actions when components mount, unmount, or when state changes.
• How to call APIs from React and put the data into state.
• What it's like to work with an API which both sends and receives data from.
