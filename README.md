# Happy Thoughts

This was a project I did while attending Technigos frontend bootcamp. The task was to build our own form of Twitter and the idea was to practice my React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API.

## The problem

I am still struggeling with wrapping my head around JavaScript and how to use Reacts'Use effect'. The teachers codealongs was a big help and at last I got it to work.

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
