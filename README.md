# Happy Thoughts
This project was part of Technigo bootcamp. This weeks asignment was to create a site where you can post and see others happy thoughts. 


## The problem

This was a really fun project and I feel like I'm starting to get the hang of React now. It was very interesting to learn about POST requests which was new to me. I started by building everything in App.js to make it all work before breaking it out into components. 

If I had more time I would implement some animations when a message is posted!
