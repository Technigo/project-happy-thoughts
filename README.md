# Happy Thoughts

This project was done during week 7 of Technigo's Boot Camp. It is about working with changes in state or a component mounting using useEffect in React, as well as fetching and posting data to an API.

## The problem

I used the structure from week 7's example project, but changed and added components to fit this sites needs better. I think it was a very challenging project, testing our understanding from previous projects aswell as the new material. The part I struggled the most with was the like button trying to post likes back to the API.
