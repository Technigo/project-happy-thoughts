A Twitter like app with positive vibes. :sunny:

- use useEffect hook in React when components mount, unmount, or when state changes
- call APIs from React and put the data into state

## :heavy_check_mark: Features
- most recent thoughts are listed on top of the page
- thoughts showing the message and the number of likes they received
- controlled form to post new thoughts (between 5-140 characters)
