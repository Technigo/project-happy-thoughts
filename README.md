# Happy Thoughts

The task was to build a simple Twitter-like app in order to practice fetching and posting data using React. The API is shared for all students in the course.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

I began with fetching the data, then added the posting and liking functionality. If I had more time I'd add a limit to the characters one is able to enter and perhaps make the form submit upon pressing enter.


### Technologies used:

- HTML
- CSS
- React
- fetch

- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code formatting
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for deployment
