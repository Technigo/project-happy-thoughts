# Happy Thoughts
### Week 7 Technigo Bootcamp

We followed the design provided by Technigo to generate a happy thoughts page. 

This was our first week trying out Postman! The goal of the week was to learn how to use the `useEffect` hook in React to perform actions when components mount, unmount, or when state changes and how to call APIs from React and put the data into state. We also learned in general what it is like to work with an API from which you both send and receive data.

## The problem
Using React and Postman to retrieve information from an API which allows all the students to post happy thoughts within our projects. The project features an input area to add your own happy thought as well as the last 20 happy thoughts uploaded to the system. The previous thoughts display hearts which can be pressed and each selection is counted and the number of hearts/happy thought are listed next to the hearts. 

We were given a walkthrough instruction guide as well as an example project. With these two examples I was able to write the post request and get my project working.
