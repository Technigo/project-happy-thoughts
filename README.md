# Happy Thoughts

The assignment this week was to create a social media "wall" where happy thoughts can be posted. This is created with fetching data from an API and POSTing new data in a form. This is also created with seperate components in React. The assignment was also to keep as close as possible to a given design. 

## The problem

I started with creating the different components I thought I was going to need. After that I fetched the already existing statuses from the API. My next step was the CSS and creating the look of the form. I found it difficult to make the like-buttons work and add likes. I ended up spending alot of time figuring that one out. If I had more time I would have created a counter for keeping track of how many likes the user has made.
