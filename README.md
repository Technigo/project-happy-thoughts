# Happy Thoughts

This assignment involves fetching and posting data into an API from React, putting data into a state and using the 'useEffect'Â hook in React to perform actions when components mount, unmount, or when state changes.
 
## The problem

I initially made the example project provided for the week and once that was working I started to implement the happy-thoughts project with the same template, having a thoughtsList component and a thoughtForm component. I then reaslised that in order to keep count of the likes for each individual thought, I would need a third separate component with a counter that did that.

I still need to make the form also submit with the press of the enter-button, not just the click of the submit button. With more time I would also implement a countdown counter for the amount of character's the user has entered.
