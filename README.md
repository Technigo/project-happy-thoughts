# Happy Thoughts
The assignment was to create an app where you can post your happy thoughts (similar to Twitter). The message is posted to a public API, and the app also fetches the latest 20 messages posted to the API. Yoy can "like" other messages by clicking the heart-button.

## The problem
I made one component for the form where the user can type their message, and two components for the messages that are fetched from the API ()

To change the color on the heart-button when the message has one or more likes I used inline styling with ternary operator. I used the same technique to make a character counter that shows hos many characters you've written, and the text turns red when there are 5 or less characters left. 

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?
