Description

This project is simple API to collect and share'happy thoughts' to make the world a better place. Almost like Twitter but with love only.


What did I do?

I started to use APIs  firing requests within `useEffect`. Then i put the result of API responses into React state to show in the page.
This way I learned to work with an API which you both send and receive data from. I ended with CSS.

If I had more time I would of styled it more and worked more on the acessability design.
