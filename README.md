# Happy Thoughts ❤️

This week's project was to continue practicing React state by fetching and posting data - happy thoughts - to an API. We have worked with an API with three endpoints.

## What I have achieved

I have learnt: 

- what a component lifecycle means
- how to use the useEffect hook in React to perform actions when components mount, unmount, or when state changes.
- how to call APIs from React and put the data into state.

I have: 
 -fetched message from the API using a GET request
- have created and sent new messages using POST with a JSON body
- sent likes back - when user like a message - to the API-server using another endpoint and the method POST but without a body






Like a message When the user clicks the heart button on a thought, send a POST request (with no body) to this URL. **Replace THOUGHT_ID with the `_id` parameter of the thought the user clicked on**

- How to use APIs in React, firing requests within `useEffect`.
- How to put the result of API responses into React state to show in the page.
- What it's like to work with an API which you both send and receive data from.

- Your page should follow the design as closely as possible
- You should list the most recent thoughts at the top and older thoughts at the bottom (sorted)
- Your thoughts should show the content of the message and how many likes they've received
- You should have a form to post new thoughts
- You should implement the heart button to send likes on a thought

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?
