# Happy Thoughts

Small Twitter-like application collecting happy thoughts. The application is fetching and posting data by using React and endpoints of a custom API

## The problem

The application is split up into components for posting new thoughts to the api, listing thoughts fetched from the API, liking thoughts and posting the likes to the API.

The user can sort the thoughts and navigate between pages of thoughts. It is optional to enter a name when posting.

If I had more time I would've liked to add a generic button component, using it for all buttons of the application.
