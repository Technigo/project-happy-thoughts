# Happy thoughts web app made with React

Happy thoughts is a web app where you can post and like short messages. The page is made with React and fetches and posts data to an API. One of my projects during Technigo frontend boot camp.

## What did I do?

I started with looking at the API data, then planned what components I should use. Then I made sure that I could fetch and present the data as I wanted. After that I added the form and the post request. I added the functionality to the like button at the end.

In this project I used React, hooks, JSX and CSS. The layout was made with flexbox and grid.
