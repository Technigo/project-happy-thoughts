# Happy Thoughts

This weeks assignmet was to use a given API to fetch happy thoughts and make it look like the given design.

## The problem

I started by checking what components I needed then I did my first fetches from the API. My plan was to start early in the week so I had alrady written some code before the frist live session on monday.

This week I also found a mentor and we have been sitting and talking about code for one hour a day and that has helped alot.

If I had more time I would make a error message.
