# Happy Thoughts

This week I made a Happy Thoughts twitter using React state, useEffect and Postman as a project for Technigo Frontend boot camp.

## The problem

Man oh man, was this project mind boggling. I started with fetching the data from the API in useEffect, using State, and making a component for posting new message to the API. Then I had a real struggle wrapping my head around dependencies for useEffect and deconstructing props for child components. I followed code-alongs several times to understand the logic but I'm not fully there yet. I will have to practice more with React state and useEffect to get the hang of it.
