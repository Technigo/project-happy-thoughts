# Happy Thoughts

This week's project was to create an app like Twitter where
you can post your happy thougths.

## The problem

The app is created using React. It fetches and collects data from an API created for this week's project. I have a different component for the form that is used to post my happy thoughts and a different component for the posts that the app receives from the API. With React useEffect hook I fetch the data from the API when the App is mounted.In my Posts component I have used the useState hook to change the background color of the button when I like a post. the design follows the guidelines given for the project.

Updated: The API url was replaced with the one I created for this project. For the front-end project I added a user section. Also the user can choose how nany results will be displayed per page.
