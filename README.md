# Happy Thoughts

This site is connected to a server and we are fetching the api for GET and POST to develop this chat function of Happy Thoughts.

I started by collecting all the fetching in the app component, but I had to start again with a new approach because I lost myself when I had to solve the like button. Too bad, because I had something good going on.
