# Happy Thoughts

Happy Thoughts is a webb-application where the user can send a happy thought and read other peoples happy thoughts. 

## The problem

This project focuses on JavaScript, React and communicating with API's. It was really interesting to finally start posting to an API, and realising how few lines of code it requires. The styling of the page was given as an image, and I loved recreating the details such as different colors of the like-button depending on number of likes and hovering-effects.
