# Happy Thoughts

During this weeks project we're looking at how to react to changes in state or a component mounting using useEffect.

## The problem

✓ What component lifecycle means.

✓ How to use the `useEffect` hook in React to perform actions when components mount, unmount, or when state changes.

✓ How to call APIs from React and put the data into state.

✓ What it's like to work with an API which you both send and receive data from.

If I had more time I would like to make sure the like-buttons worked properly (don't wan't the page to reload when you click it and the color should change when clicked). Also the input-box got a strange size-changing-function to it that´s not really supposed to be there.
