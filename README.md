# Happy Thoughts

This project was an introduction to useEffect in React and using APIs and to do GET and POST requests with React.


## The problem

I started with deciding on the components I wanted to use and thinking about the structure of the app. APIs, useState and useEffect were used to handle data, decide how and when to render the components. The App.js was used as the "parent" component where the GET and POST requests were done and then it was passed down as props from one "child" component to another. If I had more time I would have added a counter that counts how many characters are left and validation.
