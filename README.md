# Happy Thoughts

This assignment was about fetching and posting data to an API. It's a "happy thoughts" -app where you can post happy thoughts and let other people read them. The app was created using React, API GET and POST methods, useStates and useEffects.

## The problem

Hard part of this project was to keep all the things together and separate elements succesfully to different components.
