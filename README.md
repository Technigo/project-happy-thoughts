# Happy Thoughts

This weeks project was about creating a feed fetching and posting data from an API. The project was created using React.


## The problem

I started by creating a Main component to act as the parent component and then fetching the data from the API inside it. Then I created a new fetch for posting data to the API and divided part of the code into smaller components. In the end I added styling and animation features.
