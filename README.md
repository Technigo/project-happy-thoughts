# Happy Thoughts

This is an app that uses an API to collect happy thoughts.

## The problem

In React I used an API built by Technigo to display happy thoughts that other user have posted. There is also a form to post one of your own and there is also a like-function. I used useState and useEffect in order to build the app.
