# Week 11: Happy Thoughts

This week's project was to practice React state and effect hooks by fetching and posting data to an API, in a Twitter-like but more positive app.

## The problem

The structure was quite easy to set up. The project itself was simple but I struggled on too many details, like finding a way to refresh the likes (it was an issue about structure). If I had more time, I would have found an elegant way to add a loading state.

I'm happy with what my app looks like both on mobile and desktop. Tiny details make all the difference.
