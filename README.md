# Happy Thoughts

A project utilizing React useState and useEffect, making an app that, with the help of an API, fetches and posts text inputs and likes.

## The problem

The code along sessions and previous excersizes using useEffect and useState helped alot. I did struggle for a bit with the posting and fetching beyond the basic thought display but recieved help to connect the dots between the code I had written. A new feature used was formatDistance from date-fns. I am pretty satisfied in total since I manage to do the stretch goals for this project aswell.
