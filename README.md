# Happy Thoughts
This is an app where you can post happy thoughts.

## The problem

The project is built in React, using three components. One for the new message, one for the list of the latest messages and one for the like-button. I started by making the messages show and then created a form to be able to post to the API. useEffect is used when calling the API. I made the like button its own component. The form button is disabled until the message is validated.
I added a react-spinner for the messages loading and some css animation to the buttons.
If I had had more time I would have liked to add a tooltip when the messages is too short or too long.
