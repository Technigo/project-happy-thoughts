Week 11 of Technigo's Bootcamp

Building a nicer and smaller version of Twitter, to practice React state by fetching and posting data to an API. Technigo built a simple API for us to use.

This week I got to try to work with an API which I both sent to and received data from. I got to practise to use API in React and how to put the result in to React state to show it on the page.

# Design

The design was set from school and I had to make my result as similar as possible.
