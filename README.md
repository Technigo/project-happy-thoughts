# Happy Thoughts

In this project, I practiced my React skills by fetching and posting data to a Twitter-like API with 'happy thoughts'. 

## The problem

I started by writing all my functions in the app.js file. Then I added the styling. Lastly, I divided app.js into components. 

When I have time, I want to make the app more user-friendly by adding error messages when the user writes more than 140 characters, less than five, or leaves the field empty. Moreover,  I could handle loading states, keep track of the number of posts the user has liked, and store that number.
