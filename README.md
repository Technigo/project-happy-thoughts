# Happy Thoughts

My own version of Twitter. Consists of a main form with an input, and below the answers in the form are shown. 
Happy, pastel lights colors were used to build the web. 

## The problem

- My third project using React and building different components. Playing around with importing and exporting, writng a clear and easy to follow code using this Java Script library. 
- Second project with the State Hook and the first with the Effect Hook. 
- Fatching data with a public API (this API was shared with other students for the sue of their project).
- User can write their own happy thoughts and like some of the already published: when the user clicks the heart button on a thought, it sends a POST request (with no body) to the API URL, and the icon changes the color.
