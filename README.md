# Happy Thoughts

This was one of the projects at the Technigo bootcamp. We used an API to collect and post 'happy thoughts'. Think of it as a version of Twitter, but with less negativity, and 100% fewer US presidents using it. 

## The problem

There were three main steps or problems in this project. The first was to collect the 'happy thoughts' from the API and make them show up as a list. The second was to be able to post your own 'happy thought' to the API and see it show up in the list with the other thoughts. The third was to add a like-function so that you could click a like-button and see how many likes each thought had received. 

## Learning objectives
