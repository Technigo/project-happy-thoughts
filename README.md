# Happy Thoughts

A project done in React, with the purpose of displaying API:s in both GET and POST.

## The problem

I struggled a lot with this project. I had a hard time structuring the code in a way that felt logical to me. After consulting chat-GPT and viewing a few other students projects I finally found my way.
If I had more time I would find a way to align the timer better. It frustrates me that it's not properly justified to the right, the alignment shifts depending on the length of the sentence.
I would also implement a window alert. I chose not to use one now, since I didn't have time to figure out how to only show it if the user tries to submit with the wrong length, it kept showing on every keystroke from 1-4.
