## 1. What is this?
Happy thoughts is a page where you can post and like short messages. The page is made in React and fetches och posts data to an API.

## 2. What did I do?

The requirements for this project was to follow the design as closely as possible
to list the most recents thoughts, have form to post new thoughts and the ability to like
a thought.

I started with looking at the API data, then planned what components I should use.
Then I made sure that I could fetch and present the data as I wanted. After that I added the form and the post request. I added the functionality to the like button at the end.

In this project I used
* `useEffect`
* `useState`
* CSS grid
* Flexbox
