# A Twitter-like form using React

This week's project consisted on creating a Twitter-like form by learning React's components life cycle and how to react to changes in state or a component mounting using useEffect.

# Learning objectives

- What component lifecycle means.
- How to use the useEffect hook in React to perform actions when components mount, unmount, or when state changes.
- How to call APIs from React and put the data into state.

## How I built it

With this project I confirmed even more the importance of planning ahead before starting coding as it reduces the amount of corrections and changes.
As last week I started by setting all the elements in the parent container and when all the code was working as it should then I started created the smaller components.

If I've had more time I would have added the counter for characters in the input field and also had added a changing colour when the like button is clicked. I also would like to experiment passing states as props.
