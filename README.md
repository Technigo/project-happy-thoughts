# Happy Thoughts

This is a project built in React that works similarly to Twitter. The app is communicating with an API to create happy thoughts and show a feed of the latest 20 happy thoughts. There is also a like functionality. We use both useState and useEffect to manage the calls in a standarized React way.

## The problem

I have split the project into different components based on the provided design. I have used useState and useEffect to manage the calls to the API and to automatically add freshly created thoughts to the feed.
