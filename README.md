## Happy Thoughts App
Week 7 at Technigo and we are building a Happy Thought website which is similar to Facebook, Twitter and inspires users to share positive thoughts. The goals are to GET and POST data to a simple API, and to master React hook (useState, useEffect). In addition, I re-designed the UI based on Technigo's template in order to add more functionalities and make it more user friendly.

### The problem
At the beginning, it was challenging for me to understand how to use 'useEffect' in React effectively (pun unintended). After hours of Googling and learning from external learning platforms, I turned to be more confident to work with React and started to implement the useEffect in different cases to get the best out of it. 

Besides that, my goal was to save the posts which were liked by users to local storage and display them nicely on the site. The final solutions was to save the item to local storage every time the user click Like and update them directly in the initial useState. So the posts will not be lost after the page is refreshed.
