# Happy Thoughts 😁💖

The goal of this project was to build a Twitter-like app, using a provided simple API with three endpoints. The app collects a happy thought provided by the user and the messages can be "liked" with a like button. 

## The problem 🤔

I started my project by carefully planning and thinking how many components I should use. Nontheless, later on I discovered that I needed more components than I originally thought I would. I solved this by starting by creating all the components in the App first, which proved to be a little complicated when separating them because I had to be aware of the useStates and exported urls.

If I had more time, I would add the words counter, which I tried but failed. I would also like to add the loader but this was a stretch goal and it requires a little bit of time and reflection.

On a side note, I'm very proud of the way I was able to style it more or less similar to the model. I'm still working on my css skills, and it has proved to be one of my weak ones.

<h2>What I learned 💪</h2> 

It's far more convenient to work with React components, but it requires more planning.
I got a better handle of JavaScript methods applied to functions.
I also got a little bit more practice on fetching and posting data to an API.
It was also exciting to take a first little look at what goes on in the backend!
