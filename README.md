# Happy Thoughts

The goal of this project was to create a functioning interative feed, allowing you to take part of and like others "happy thougts" as well as posting your own. 

## The problem

The main challenge this week was to introduce useEffect in my code and know when to implement it. When time allows I will add a loading page for the entire webpage and also a charachter counter for the input field.
