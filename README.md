# Happy Thoughts

This project was made during the Technigo Bootcamp.
The app is similar to Twitter but with only happy thougths! 

The project was made using React and the main goal was to practice fetcing data from the Happy thoughts API and using both useState and useEffect React Hooks.


## The problem

I started with a mobile first approach and built a React skelaton. My app contains a  main Component, a HappyForm component where you can post new messages and a HappyThoughtList component where i display the older messages and also where you can like other peoples messages.  

I've used React useEffect to control the API and to avoid an infinite loop. 

I have disabled the send button on the Happy form when the text input does not fulfill the requirements. 

The app is also responsive.
