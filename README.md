# Happy Thoughts

The project "Happy Thoughts" is about practicing React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API.

## The problem

Basic requirements:
Following the provided design.
Publishing the most recent thoughts at the top and older thoughts at the bottom of the page.
The thoughts show the content of the message and how many likes they've received.
Having a form to post new thoughts.
Implementing the heart button to send likes on a thought.

Stretch goals:
Show a count below the form input that updates as the user types and shows how many characters are remaining. Make it go red when the user has typed over 140 characters
When POSTing a new thought, if the message was empty, too long, or too short, you get an error message back from the API.
Handling loading states.
Keep count of how many different posts the user have liked.
