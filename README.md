# Happy Thoughts

Built with React, this app allows the user to send messages of up to 140 characters to an API and view messages other users have submitted to the API as well. 

## The problem

Still catching up on React after taking a 2-week hiatus from Technigo, so I found this project very challenging. I'm happy with the end result, but I've relied a lot on peeking at other people's code. My focus was on ensuring that I properly understood how the app works, and I did so by adding thorough explanations for every block of code via comments.

If I'd had more time, I would have tried adding additional features such as restricting the number of times a user can press the 'like' button to only once.
