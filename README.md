# Happy Thoughts

The project is a web page to post, visualize and like posts (similiar to Twitter). It was created using React components and an unique API (https://myhappy-thoughts-api.herokuapp.com/).

# Features

- Use of hooks - useState and useEffect.
- Use of components to organize the code.
- Send button disable for messages under 5 and over 150 characters.
- A like button including a counter.

# Production Process

- I started by planning the code structure and creating different components for specific functions.
- The thoughts were initally fetched through an API provided by Technigo, but I changed later for one I created.
- The design followed a guideline, using the mobile first approach.
