# Happy Thoughts

## This project was built as part of Technigo's front-end developer boot camp, Fall 2020

In this project, I've built a simple, but yet public, API with three endpoints. Think of it as a version of Twitter, but with less negativity, and 100% fewer US presidents using it.

The design was given via the project.

## The problem

The recent posts are fetched, new posts can sent in and posts can be liked.
The hardest part was/is to understand the workflow of the API. How different components communicate with each other and where to place things.

## View it live

The site is deployed <a href="https://silly-carson-4bd53e.netlify.app">here.</a>  
Share some happy thoughts, 2020 needs it badly.
