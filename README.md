# Happy Thoughts
In this week's project, you'll be able to practice your React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API.

✓ Your page should follow the design as closely as possible ✓ You should list the most recent thoughts at the top and older thoughts at the bottom (sorted) ✓ Your thoughts should show the content of the message and how many likes they've received ✓ You should have a form to post new thoughts ✓ You should implement the heart button to send likes on a thought.
