# Happy Thoughts

The assignment was to build "Happy Thoughts" version of Twitter. The site had to follow the given design. 


## The problem

This week's goal was to learn how to use useEffect hook in React and also how to call APIs from React and put the data into state.

I started this project by sketching the project on paper and planning how to divide the components. First I had App, Form and ThoughtList components. After Wednesday's lecture I created also Thought component. Then I did the fetch requests and all needed functionalities. I did the styling with CSS and flexbox alongside building the project.

If I would have hade more time I would have made the counter which calculates characters which user types to textarea. Also I would have made some hover effects etc.
