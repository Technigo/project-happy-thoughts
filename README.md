# Happy Thoughts

In week 7, the task was to build a front-end for a public API used to collect 'happy thoughts', using React. Later on in week 15, we built our own API and hooked it up with the front-end built in week 7.

## The brief

In this week's project, you'll be able to practice your React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API.

**What you need to do**

✓ Your page should follow the design as closely as possible

✓ You should list the most recent thoughts at the top and older thoughts at the bottom (sorted)

✓ Your thoughts should show the content of the message and how many likes they've received

✓ You should have a form to post new thoughts

✓ You should implement the heart button to send likes on a thought

## What improvements I'd like to add in the future

- Infinite scrolling
- A delete endpoint for deleting thoughts
- Animations to the thought cards
