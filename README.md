# Happy Thoughts

The project was about creating a Twitter like application that was more focused on positivity. The project make us use the React state by fetching the posting data to the API. 

## The problem

I started with fetching the thoughts from the API and list them in the browser. After that I built a component to post a new thought to the API and then I implemented a like button to that. I then add some styling to make the app look good.
