# Happy Thoughts

This is a project where I learnt to fetch and post messages via API.


## The problem

I didnt have to many major problem this week, but a few once occured ofcourse. I did solve the minor situation by googeling and talking to my team.

I enjoyed this project and the structure of learning it. I did get a lot of help from Technigo Bootcamps lectures and that made me feel more secure and confident in trying some more things and also to have the time to acctually reflect over what the code and functions do and how they works. 

Next step in this project would be to add some more cool features, like animation and characters count.
