# Happy Thoughts
This week we were suppose to do likw a twitter app but ofr happy thoughts with React.  

## The problem

Unfortunately I did not solve the problem with how to update the api with happy thoughts from my app or get the likes part to work. I have had a very stressful week so hav'nt had the time to really understand how to solve the problem. I had all the design in. But the code does not work as it should. Wish I had the time to really solve it and understand it.
