# Happy Thoughts

This week we continued with React and started using useEffects. By using API to both get and post information we built a app that received and sent messages and posted them in the app.

## The problem

There wasn't really a problem this week. But I noticed that remembering and keeping in mind all things we already learned about useState, props and components became a bit confusing. All the parts separatly are clear but combining all parts does need you to think a bit more. But it was really fun and unsing all things you've learned previously is good repetition and sets everything into a new and bigger perspective.
