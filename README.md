# Happy Thoughts

Replace this readme with your own information about your project.

We were to make an app using react.js. The user should be able to post messages, see earlier attributions and like them. The buttons and posting also had som requiremensts like color shifting and required chars lengths. 

It has been a fun, yet special week. The project went well, but to me, react is like learning a new language. I need to practice more to make it stick for real. But I guess programming is a constant learning. 

I liked the styling alot because it made me questioning and understanding my code better. It is still an adventure to understand what kind of styling that is accetable to react (and netlify). 

I added some og-tags for the first, hopefully it will work. 

if I had more time I would add a header and a chars counter.
