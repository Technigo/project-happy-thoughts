# Happy Thoughts

This week's project was to create a site to collect and post user's "happy thoughts" in a feed, by using React hooks and fetch and post data to and from an API, practising using the methods 'GET' and 'POST'.

## The problem

After going through this week's material I started practising by doing the example project for this week, it had some issues to deal with that was discussed in our slack forums where I found the help. After those issues where solved, t he example project was a really good template to start with for this project. However, it wasn't until we had our Tuesday live code session and I looked at other people's code, picking it apart and coding along, that I started to grasp what the different parts of the code was doing and how it was connected. In the Thursday live code session Daniel went through things that helped me solve some of the bugs in my site, for example that my thoughts wasn't posted correctly because of the composition of my fetch requests. My team was also really valuable this week, especially with understanding how to code the like-button to make only that part of the page refresh and not the whole page, when someone pressed that button.
