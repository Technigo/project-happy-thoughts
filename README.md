# Happy Thoughts
**Brief**
In this week's project, you'll be able to practice your React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API.

**What you need to do**
✓ Your page should follow the design as closely as possible
✓ You should list the most recent thoughts at the top and older thoughts at the bottom (sorted)
✓ Your thoughts should show the content of the message and how many likes they've received
✓ You should have a form to post new thoughts
✓ You should implement the heart button to send likes on a thought

## The problem
Started the project by doing an animated background and header to get inspired.
After that I watched the recorded Live Session(tuesday) and coded along from the part where Daniel showed how to display the messages and add "loading", styled it to look like the feed from the design and then added the feed-elements one by one - used placeholders before I figured out how to fetch the likes and date.
Used the instructions for the project to figure out how to make a post and then styled the form to look like the design and so on with the rest. It felt more fun to take one element at a time and add the styling before moving forward to the next.
