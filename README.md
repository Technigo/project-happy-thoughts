Project making a Twitter clone with React components and useState/useEffect.

## The problem

Started by making a working build with fetching API information and displaying it on a page with useStates, useEffect and some minor styling.
Added other functions like a counter for characters in the textarea, disabled button if text too short or too long and made the textarea counter text red in that case. Animated heart for while the site is loading.

If I had more time I would've wanted to dive down even deeper for understanding the useEffect and how everything works together, and add even more functions.
