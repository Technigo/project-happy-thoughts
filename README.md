# Happy Thoughts

 This project was to build an app where you can post short messages. The messages are fetched from an open API and then posted to the API from the website. THe project is build in React.

## The problem

- This was the first time as I posted data to an API. Since it was my first time using this method, it was a bit tricky at the beginning but after some trial and error I finally got hold of it. Posting to the API was the trickiest part of this project, everything else went very smoothly because I've pretty much done all the other pats in my earlier projects. 

- The app is build to look like a given design, I also added some extra design elements such as hover effects etc. 

- I chose to do the stretch goal with a character counter, so the user know how many characters they have written, as I thought it was a nice touch to the site. 

- If I had more time on this project I would include an error message to the user if they were to try to post a message that's to long or to short. Instead I just gave the textarea a min lenght and a max lenght, and set it to required.
