# Happy Thoughts

The task was to create sort of like simple twitter. The user can post a happy thought that will be added to the API and displayed along the other messages written by other users. 

## The problem

I started with sketching out the components that I wanted. I wanted one for displaying the messages, one for posting messages and one for liking messages. I created the first two components and along the way I realized that I didn't need a 3rd component for liking messages. It felt that it would be a bit more complicated than necessary. I was able to do the fetch request for the messages, later I did a second fetch request for posting a message using the a fetch request with the POST method. And lastly I did another fetch request for adding the like, it was a bit tricky but me and antoher teammate figured it out. The refresh of the page wasn't so smooth though and after Thursday's live session I tweaked the fetch-requests so that they became smoother (and the whole page wouldn't "jump" for every refresh). 

I was able to add some animation for when a new message was added by the user to the message list. (I asked ChatGPT and implemented their solution to my code). I also asked another student about how she added the confetti effects for the likes. And lastly I added a footer that would go on top of the other components and be shown at the bottom of the browser. 

This was a fun project and I learned a lot!
