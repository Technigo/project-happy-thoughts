# Happy Thoughts

For this assignment, I made a twitter-like page that can receive new post and display recent posts.

## The problem

I attended the live sessions, read all the materials and watched the recorded videos to start with. I also google a lot and look at other students' project to see how they did it. I discussed many problems with my teammates for many hours.
If I had more time, I would use it to rewatch more all the videos and maybe put more fun stuff on the page like putting in your username, but for now I'm happy with it.
