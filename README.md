# Happy Thoughts

This project was to practice React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API. 

## The problem

I first try to understand this weeks example, when I got that covered I could make the changes to make the project. We practice useState, useEffect and coninuing with buildning React components. If had more time I would divide some more code in more components to make app.js a bit less crowded.
