Week 11 - Technigo Bootcamp - Happy Thoughts

Happy Thoughts is a "Twitter" kind app using React hooks (useState and useEffect) by posting and receiving data from an API, then use GET- and POST-requests to display and add new thoughts/likes to a list of happy thoughts. 

During this project I got introdued to the full concept of the component lifecycle, how to use useEffect hook in React to make  components mount, unmount, or when state changes.
