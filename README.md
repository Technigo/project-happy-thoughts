# Happy Thoughts

This project was for practicing React states by fecthing and posting data to and API, and also follow a given an design we were supposed to follow as much as possible.

## The problem

The workflow for this project was very straight forward. I was unsure how to start so I coded along with the lecture provided, and then continued to do so for the rest of the lectures. I found it very easy to follow along and understand what was happening in the code. I tried time to time to write my own code in beforehand when I felt confident and that worked for the most part. I stayed updated with the questions my team-mates were asking in class and in Slack and StackOverflow, so when I ran into the same problem I already knew how to solve it. Also the styling was quite easy, except for fiding the correct fonts which was not provided, so the fonts in my project isn't exactly the same as in the design we were given but close enough I think.

If I've had more time I would like to have made a mockup myself to plan how to divide the code in components and then trying to the project more by myself. I would also have liked doing a character counter that updates when typing to see how many character the user have used and have left, and also add some animations when a new message appears.
