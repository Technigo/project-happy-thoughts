# Happy Thoughts

I here have made a Twitter Clone using REACT.js where I can fetch messages posted on herokupp and also post them and add likes to the posts. Also I can check how long back the post was made using MOMENT.js and added some validations depending on the length of the message.

In addition I have also created a backend using Express, NodeJS MongoDB and NodeJs

## The problem

Initially I was planning on breaking down the project into smaller components but then decided against it since they were not getting reused. I did however use a different component to make a like button which was quite a challenge as I was not able to post but after an almost frustrating half day I finally had a light- bulb moment and was able to get it working.
