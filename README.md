# Happy Thoughts

We here have made a Twitter Clone using REACT.js where we can fetch messages posted on herokupp and also post them and add likes to the posts. Also we check how long back the post was made using MOMENT.js and added some validations depending on the length of the message.

## The problem

Initially I was planning on breaking down the project into smaller components but then decided against it since they were not getting reused. I did however use a different component to make a like button which was quite a challenge as I was not able to post but after an almost frustrating half day I finally had a light- bulb moment and was able to get it working.
