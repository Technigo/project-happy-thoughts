# Happy Thoughts

In this week's project, you'll be able to practice your React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API.

We've built a simple API to collect 'happy thoughts'. Think of it as our own version of Twitter, but with less negativity, and 100% fewer US presidents using it.

## What you will learn ðŸ§ 

- How to use APIs in React, firing requests within `useEffect`.
- How to put the result of API responses into React state to show in the page.
- What it's like to work with an API which you both send and receive data from.
