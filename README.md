# Happy Thoughts

This week's project we got to practice our React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API.

**What we needed to do:**

âœ“ Follow the design given to us as closely as possible

âœ“ List the most recent thoughts at the top and older thoughts at the bottom (sorted)

âœ“ Thoughts should show the content of the message and how many likes they've received

âœ“ Have a form to post new thoughts

âœ“ Implement the heart button to send likes on a thought

## The problem

This was a great exercise in passing different datatypes as props from one component to another, learning more about the flow of it all ðŸ˜ƒ. I started out with three components and by the time I was finished I had five.

Since this was the first time making post requests to an api that whole thing was a bit tricky, but I learned a lot from changing some things back and forth, error messages etc.

I found Stack Overflow very helpful for this project. I know it's a great resource but I haven't been using it as much in the previous projects.
