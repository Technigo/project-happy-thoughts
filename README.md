# Happy Thoughts

In this week's project, I practiced React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API. It included the useState and useEffect.

We've built a simple API to collect 'happy thoughts'. Think of it as our own version of Twitter, but with less negativity, and 100% fewer US presidents using it. 

### Fetch recent thoughts

`GET https://technigo-thoughts.herokuapp.com/`


### Create a thought

`POST https://technigo-thoughts.herokuapp.com/`


### Like a thought

`POST https://technigo-thoughts.herokuapp.com/THOUGHT_ID/like`

## I have learned: ðŸ§ 

* How to use APIs in React, firing requests within `useEffect`.
* How to put the result of API responses into React state to show in the page.
* What it's like to work with an API which you both send and receive data from.
