This is "Project Happy Thoughts"!
Almost like a Twitter, but for happy thougts only. You can post and like other people's happy thoughts. 

I have been working with React and created a skeleton for this app, that in the long rund can be more advanced with components and further functions included. You can find the project live here: https://projecthappythoughts.netlify.com
