# Happy Thoughts

This is a project made with React states by fetching and posting data to an API. In this React app you'll see the latest 20 posts from other users, like the posts and add your own post.

## The problem

I started to plan which components I needed to build this app. Then I created the components and did the first fetch to get the post list to show. After that I went on to posting data to the API and then fetching likes on other user's posts. When the fetching and posting was almost done I started working on the styling. 

The project was mainly about practice react hooks, useState and useEffect. I also learned more about JSX and working with APIs in React.
