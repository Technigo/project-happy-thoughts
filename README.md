# Happy Thoughts

Replace this readme with your own information about your project.

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

- I thought this was a fun project, but it also was really hard.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

- I struggled so much with the function "post new message "and also to be able to "like new message". But I made it work so it updates automatically.

- I am most proud of that I fixed the whole project.

## View it live
