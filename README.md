# Happy Thoughts

In this week's project we practiced React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API.

## The problem

I had issues with some fetching logic so I checked out my older projects where we had to fetch, I also had help from some classmates. It was hard to get it to work beacuse the error message did not specify what the error was just that something is wrong so it had me tripping for a while.. :D
