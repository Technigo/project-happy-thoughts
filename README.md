# Happy Thoughts
In this project we created a site in react that was fetching and posting data from an API.
On the site you can post a tweet, see other tweets and like a tweet.

Requirements

✓ Your page should follow the design as closely as possible

✓ You should list the most recent thoughts at the top and older thoughts at the bottom (sorted)

✓ Your thoughts should show the content of the message and how many likes they've received

✓ You should have a form to post new thoughts

✓ You should implement the heart button to send likes on a thought

## The problem

I made a figma-file to plan the week and the design. I started working on fetching the tweets first, then the form. I added some design before I finally managed to create a like function, updating the likes. The last part was a bit challanging and I got stuck. Happy to solve it at the end.
