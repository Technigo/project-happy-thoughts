# Happy Thoughts

For this project I have built a simple API to collect 'happy thoughts'. See the repository for the API here: https://github.com/amandatilly/project-happy-thoughts-api
In this repo I have built the frontend for project happy thoughts. Think of it as my own version of Twitter, but with less negativity.

## The problem

Built with React, using the UseEffect hook.
