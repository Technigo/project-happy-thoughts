# Happy Thoughts

This project was about building a "message-app, which is connected to an api. The user can post a new message and read a list of previous messages..

## The problem

The learning objectives for this project was to
-Use React state and Effect hooks
-Fetch data from an API and update the state with new data
-post data to an API

I've mainly structured my project according to the "Waterfall" approach, i.e the fetches and posting are made in the App cononent. I the MessageList component the input data and a timestamp is printed out. In the MessageInput component the input form is created, wehere the user can type a message. The heartButton component prints out the "hear-button" for likes. It also fetches a url with likes-id. It sends props to the MessageList component, where the number of likes are updated and printed out.


Tech I've used:
-React.js 
-JavaScript
-JSX
-API
