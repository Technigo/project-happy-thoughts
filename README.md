# Happy Thoughts ❤️

This week's project was to continue practicing React state by fetching and posting data - happy thoughts - to an API. We have worked with an API with three endpoints.

## What I have achieved

I have learnt: 

- what a component lifecycle means
- how to use the useEffect hook in React to perform actions when components mount, unmount, or when state changes.
- how to call APIs from React and put the data into state.

In this project, I have: 
- fetched message from the API using a GET request
- have created and sent new messages using POST with a JSON body
- sent likes back - when user like a message - to the API-server using another endpoint and the method POST but without a body

In sum, this week has taught me how to use APIs in React, and how to fire requests within 'useEffect'. I have also learned how to put the results from the API responses into React state to output in the browser. This week I have both sent and received data from an API-server.

# Requirements for this week

The page should follow the design - and it does. Further, the site should sort the most recent messages at the top and older ones at the bottom. The site should also show the content of the message and how many likes each message has received. There should also be a form in which a user can post a message. The heart button should be clickable and onclick send a like as a new message.

All this I have achieved. The site it also responsive and has a button that is validated and set to 'disable' if the validation fails.
- Your page should follow the design as closely as possible
- You should list the most recent thoughts at the top and older thoughts at the bottom (sorted)
- Your thoughts should show the content of the message and how many likes they've received
- You should have a form to post new thoughts
- You should implement the heart button to send likes on a thought

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?
