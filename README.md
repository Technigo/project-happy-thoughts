# Happy Thoughts
This is an app built with react, connected to an API. In here you can read happy thoughts or post your own. It's also possible to like posts by clicking on the like button.

## The problem
I started with fetching the thoughts from the API and list them in the browser. After that I built a form to post a new thought to the API and then I implemented the like button.
When I got this to work I decided to restructure my code and move all fetches in to App.js. That's where my problems started. It was tricky to access the right data but eventually I mangaed to get it right.

We had a design to follow but I wanted to deviate a bit from the original since I think a happy thought form needs some color ðŸŒˆ
