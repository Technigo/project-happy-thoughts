# The project
For this project, we had to create "nice twitter" app, that fetches thoughts from and API, and posts new thought to that API as well. We had include a like-button as well.

## Problems and tools
This project was a struggle to begin with, and it took some time to get the post-requests to work. In one case, it turned out to be a minor typo bugging everything up. Getting an overview of the components + what goes is still a challenge. 

Tools used for this project:
Html, CSS, JavaScript, React, Canva, Postman.
