# Happy Thoughts App

The project for this week was to build a Twitter like happy thoughts app using React, where messages and likes were fetched and posted from/to an API.

## The problem

This week, I started with looking at the design, in order to know what to achieve. I also watched Monday lecture before putting my hands into it. I started with putting everything inside the form component, and after everything was in there, I separated it into separate components. Working with an API has so far been a favourite of mine, and this week didn't make me disappointed. This was the first time I tried posting something to an API and that worked out well. 

If I had more time, I would have added the characters counter, which I will most likely do later on.
