# Technigo React Starter App

This app has been generated using `create-react-app`, then cleaned up a little so we have a project with just the elements we need to get started.

Main abjective - practise useEffect

## Plan

1. For this weeks project I followed the lectures closely since we were given very precise directions for how to build or app
2. This appraoch was in my opinion giving me a better opportunity to grasp and read up on the concept rather than (almost forcefully) trying to come up with and creating new code. Of courser we can't always be given our code, however the change was nice and also offered a little breathing room.

3. Having said this I of course ran in to some problems anyway. Mine didn't occur until I was trying top break up a rather big root file (app.js) into smaller components. I lost functionality of the form submit and couldn't figure out why? after some time of trial and error and back tracking with the help of recorded video I reverted back to my code that once worked.

If I had given myself more time I would of course wanted to fix above mentioned hick up but also gone a bit further in exploring both red and black levels and perhaps som other functionality.

React still feels good, it's a great tool offering tons of oportunities and do have a quite logical approach. Some of the functionalty is complex and will require more training :)
