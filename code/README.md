Happy thoughts project.

This project was about creating a social media web app where you can post happy thoughts. 

ItÂ´s created with a joint API for the whole boot camp so that all the thoughts being displayed att everyones pages.
Its build in react with fetch from a external API, and with a seperate for the counting of likes. 

This project was pretty straight forward with clear goals and an already made up design. 

If I had more time I would add animation to newly posted thought and a charachter counter. 

Update! 
Added my own API so its no longer a joint.
