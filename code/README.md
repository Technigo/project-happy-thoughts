# Happy Thoughts

In this week's project we created a site similar to Twitter, named ‘happy thoughts’. We practice React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API.
## The Problem

I started with fetching the API to get the existing data in App.js After that I created two more components, one for the form where the users can post their messages and one for the message list . When I had built the structure of the app and built methods to post messages and likes to the API I finished the site of with CSS-styling.
