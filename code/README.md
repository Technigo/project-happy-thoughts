# Happy Thoughts

In this week's project we created a site similar to Twitter, named ‘happy thoughts’. We practice React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API.
## The Problem

I started with fetching the API to get the existing data in App.js After that I created two more components, one for the form where the users can post their messages and one for the message list . When I had built the structure of the app and built methods to post messages and likes to the API I finished the site of with CSS-styling.

I had problems with the message not being deleted from the message field when sent and also on how to get the counter of characters to increase when writing messages. My team, Google and Stack overflow helped me overcome my problems.
